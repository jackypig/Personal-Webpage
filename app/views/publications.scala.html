            <p class="abstract">A novel approach to the calculation of plasmon resonance in metallic nanoparticle
                located nearby a dielectric object is presented. The plasmon resonance problem for such structure
                is formulated as a constrained eigenvalue problem for specific cou- pled boundary integral equations.
                By solving this eigenvalue problem, the resonance frequencies (wavelengths) of the metallic nanoparticle
                as well as the corresponding plasmon modes are computed. In this paper, two examples of application are
                consid- ered and a good agreement between the computational results and analytical solution as well as
                with available experimental and numerical data is demonstrated.</p>

            <p class="abstract">The problem of plasmon resonances in metallic nanoparticles can be formulated as an eigenvalue
                problem under the condition that the wavelengths of the incident radiation are much larger than the
                particle dimensions. As the nanoparticle size increases, the quasistatic condition is no longer valid.
                For this reason, the accuracy of the electrostatic approximation may be compromised and appropri-
                ate radiation corrections for the calculation of resonance permittivities and resonance wavelengths
                are needed. In this paper, we present the radiation corrections in the framework of the eigenvalue
                method for plasmon mode analysis and examine their accuracy by comparing the calculation results
                with analytical solutions and experimental data. These radiation corrections are quite accurate
                when the particle dimension is less than one-half of the (resonance) wavelength. We also demon-
                strate that the optical spectra of silver nanocube suspensions can be fully assigned to dipole-type
                resonance modes when radiation corrections are introduced. Finally, our method is used to predict
                the resonance wavelengths for face-to-face silver nanocube dimers on glass substrates. These results
                may be useful for the indirect measurements of the gaps in the dimers from extinction cross section
                observations.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Circularly polarized plasmon modes in spheroidal nanoshells are studied. These plasmon modes
                are promising for all-optical magnetic recording. The formulas for the resonance wavelengths of these plasmon

                that spheroidal nanoshells are superior to spherical nanoshells as far as the nanoscale focusing of circularly

            <p class="abstract">The SERS phenomenon was studied using a large set of silver nanocube dimers programmed to self-assemble in preset locations of a patterned substrate. This SERS substrate made it possible to demonstrate the dependence of the SERS enhancement on the geometry of the silver nanocube dimers and to quantify the dispersion in the SERS enhancement obtained in an ensemble of dimers. In addition to the effects of the gap distance of the dimer and the orientation of the dimer axis relative to the laser polarization on SERS enhancement, the data reveal an interesting dependence of the site-to-site variations of the enhancement on the relative orientation of the nanocubes in the dimer. We observed the highest heterogeneity in the SERS signal intensity with face-to-face dimers and a more robust SERS enhancement with face-to-edge dimers. Numerical calculations indicate that the plasmon resonance frequencies of face-to-face dimers shift considerably with small changes in gap distance. The resonance frequency shifts make it less likely for many of the dimers to satisfy the matching condition between the photon frequencies and the plasmon resonance frequency, offering an explanation for the large site-to-site variations in SERS signal intensity. These results indicate that plasmonic nanostructure designs for SERS substrates for real-world applications should be selected not only to maximize the signal enhancement potential but also to minimize the heterogeneity of the substrate with respect to signal enhancement. The latter criterion poses new challenges to experimentalists and theorists alike.</p>

            <p class="abstract">We use the techniques of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and strain state analysis (SSA) to show the material nanostructures of two InGaN/GaN quantum-well (QW) samples. In one of the samples, a low-indium InGaN/GaN QW is grown before five high-indium ones, which are grown under the same conditions as those for growing the five QWs in another sample (the control sample). From the calibrations of the average indium contents of those QWs based on the SSA images, it is found that the QWs close to the low-indium one have higher indium contents than those in the control sample. Such an increase of indium incorporation is attributed to the pre-strain effect of the low-indium QW on the barrier layer right above it. The pre-strain effect diminishes along the growth of more QWs. This effect represents an effective approach for increasing indium contents for implementing yellow-red light-emitting diodes based on InGaN/GaN QW structures.</p>

            <p class="abstract">We compared the nano-structures of three samples of ZnO thin film on sapphire under different growth temperature conditions. Although disconnected domain structures (on the scale of 100 nm in size) were observed in the samples of high-temperature (450 °C) growth, their crystal quality is generally better than the one grown at a low temperature (200 °C), either near or away from the sapphire interface. Lattice misfits and threading dislocations were observed within a domain with the separation of around 8 nm. The sample grown at the low temperature showed a continuous structure through the ZnO layer although void-like structures might exist inside. However, its crystal quality is relatively poorer. Of the two samples with high-temperature growth, the one with initial low-temperature growth had a larger domain structure (around 150 nm in size) and relatively lower crystal quality. In particular, strong strains existed near the interface of this sample. The samples of high-temperature growth generally have higher photon emission efficiencies. Temperature-dependent integrated photoluminescence intensities of the high-temperature-growth samples show that the exciton trapping by either intrinsic donors or acceptors leads to a higher thermal quenching rate in comparison with free excitons.</p>

            <p class="abstract">The immature developments of p-type ZnO and ZnO-related ternary or quaternary compound and the small lattice mismatch between ZnO and GaN stimulate interest in the hybrid growth of ZnO and GaN. In this research, we compared the nanostructures and optical properties of two ZnO thin-film samples grown under the same conditions but on different underlying materials (sapphire and GaN). With the high growth temperature of 450 °C, both samples show domain structures. However, in contrast to the sample of ZnO on sapphire, the sample of ZnO on GaN starts with smaller domains (a few tens of nanometers in width) of almost vertical boundaries at the interface and evolves into larger domains (around 100 nm in width). The 30° twist of the basal plane in ZnO with respect to its underlying sapphire does not occur in the sample of ZnO on GaN. Within a domain of ZnO on sapphire, misfit and threading dislocations can be periodically observed along the interface with the separation of about 8 nm. The transition of the lattice structure across the interface between ZnO and GaN was quite smooth, indicating the high heterojunction quality in this sample. The x-ray diffraction results showed that the crystalline quality of ZnO on GaN is slightly better than that of ZnO on sapphire. However, based on the thermal quenching behavior of integrated photoluminescence intensity, we estimated that the optical quality of the two samples is about the same.</p>

            <p class="abstract">We compared the nano-structures of three samples of ZnO thin films grown on GaN with different growth temperature conditions. Although disconnected spiral domain structures (of the order of 100 nm in width) were observed in the samples of high-temperature growth, their crystal qualities are generally better than the one grown at low temperature, either near the GaN interface or far away from the interface. In the sample of high-temperature growth through the whole process, the domain structures extend from the interface with a smaller scale and almost vertical sharp boundaries. The sample grown at the low temperature showed a generally continuous structure from the interface. However, its crystal quality is quite poor. In the sample with initial low-temperature growth and then high-temperature growth, the ZnO layer started with a continuous structure, like the sample of low-temperature growth. However, it evolved into domain structures similar to the sample of high-temperature growth beyond about 200 nm in thickness. The samples of high-temperature growth generally have higher photon emission efficiencies. The sample grown at the high temperature through the whole growth process has the highest emission quantum efficiency.</p>
